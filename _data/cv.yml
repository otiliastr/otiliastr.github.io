  contents:
  - 'I work on machine learning methodology—primarily around vision-language models, active learning, and safety—with applications in various areas including computer vision and natural language processing. My current research focuses on two key problems:'
  - '1) Enabling domain experts to effectively build models without requiring AI expertise. I work on automating the process of mining the right kinds of data and iteratively improving the model, which spans multiple areas including modeling, active learning and distillation.'
  - '2) Improving AI Trust & Safety models to make the internet safer, by leveraging LLM and VLM capabilities to detect and counteract malicious activities. This involves fundamental research aimed at expanding the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over multimodal data, to better identify sophisticated harmful content and malicious behaviors.'
  - 'During my PhD I also worked on curriculum learning, semi-supervised learning, multi-task learning, and graph-based problems. I am also passionate about using machine learning methods for health and sciences.'
