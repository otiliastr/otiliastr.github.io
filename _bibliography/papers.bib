  abstract  = {{In recent years, the adoption of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has stood out in solving computer vision tasks, such as image classification. Researchers have proposed several architectures with varying sizes, complexities, and an increasing number of trainable parameters. For this reason, finding an optimized configuration and architecture with reduced complexity and high performance has become a very difficult task, since these configurations are totally dependent on the target classification problem and mostly depend on the optimization of a specialist in the area. To assist in the search for these optimal configurations, this work proposes the use of a multi-objective grammatical evolution framework, composed of a multi-objective search engine, a new context-free grammar responsible for creating the problem search space and a process mapping of individuals. Such a framework automatically generates and optimizes CNNs for a given image classification problem, without the need for human intervention from an expert. The framework navigates the search space using two objective functions seeking to maximize two metrics: accuracy and -score. The proposal was validated in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, KMNIST and EuroSAT datasets and the results show that the proposed method is able to generate simpler networks, but that statistically outperform (more complex) state-of-the-art CNNs in both metrics considered in the study.}}

The classification accuracy of such noisy-label learning methods depends on the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples, and the robustness of SSL to small clean sets. We address these points with a new noisy-label training algorithm, called LongReMix, which improves the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples and the robustness of SSL to small clean sets with a two-stage learning process. The stage one of LongReMix finds a small but precise high-confidence clean set, and stage two augments this high-confidence clean set with new clean samples and oversamples the clean data to increase the robustness of SSL to small clean sets. We test LongReMix on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with introduced synthetic noisy labels, and the real-world noisy-label benchmarks CNWL (Red Mini-ImageNet), WebVision, Clothing1M, and Food101-N. The results show that our LongReMix produces significantly better classification accuracy than competing approaches, particularly in high noise rate problems. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in most datasets. }},

  abstract  = {{Label noise is common in large real-world datasets, and its presence harms the training process of deep neural networks. Although several works have focused on the training strategies to address this problem, there are few studies that evaluate the impact of data augmentation as a design choice for training deep neural networks. In this work, we analyse the model robustness when using different data augmentations and their improvement on the training with the presence of noisy labels. We evaluate state-of-the-art and classical data augmentation strategies with different levels of synthetic noise for the datasets MNist, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the real-world dataset Clothing1M. We evaluate the methods using the accuracy metric. Results show that the appropriate selection of data augmentation can drastically improve the model robustness to label noise, increasing up to 177.84% of relative best test accuracy compared to the baseline with no augmentation, and an increase of up to 6% in absolute value with the state-of-the-art DivideMix training strategy.}},

  abstract = {{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the main solution for image classification tasks in different applications. Although several CNN architectures are available, there is no best architecture regardless the problem at hand. The selection of the most suitable CNN architecture is usually performed by trial and error, which may take much time and computational resources. Meta-learning (MtL) is a framework developed in machine learning to perform algorithm selection based on the meta-features of each task being solved. Such meta-features are usually descriptive characteristics extracted from the training dataset available in the task at hand. Despite the increasing attention of MtL for algorithm selection, its success strongly depends on defining relevant meta-features to represent the classification tasks of interest. This paper proposes the ImageDataset2Vec method for extracting meta-features to describe image classification datasets. ImageDataset2Vec adopts a pre-trained deep neural network to extract features from images datasets, embedding them in a single feature vector. The derived meta-features are employed by MtL to select CNN architectures for image classification. The proposed approach was evaluated for selecting among six CNN algorithms in 45 two-classes image datasets. The results showed that MtL using ImageDataset2Vec overcame different baseline methods, selecting the best possible CNN algorithm in  of the datasets. Furthermore, the proposal was statistically equivalent to the ground truth when the best CNN is recommended, i.e., when MtL does not select the best CNN, it selects a competitive algorithm. These results show that the proposal was able to extract representative features from image datasets.}}

  abstract = {{The most competitive noisy label learning methods rely on an unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples, where samples classified as noisy are re-labelled
and "MixMatched" with the clean samples. These methods have two issues in large
noise rate problems: 1) the noisy set is more likely to contain hard samples that are incorrectly re-labelled, and 2) the number of samples produced by MixMatch tends to be
reduced because it is constrained by the small clean set size. In this paper, we introduce
the learning algorithm PropMix to handle the issues above. PropMix filters out hard
noisy samples, with the goal of increasing the likelihood of correctly re-labelling the
easy noisy samples. Also, PropMix places clean and re-labelled easy noisy samples in
a training set that is augmented with MixUp, removing the clean set size constraint and
including a large proportion of correctly re-labelled easy noisy samples. We also include
self-supervised pre-training to improve robustness to high noisy label scenarios. Our
experiments show that PropMix has state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on CIFAR-10/-100

Controlled Noisy Web Labels), Clothing1M and WebVision. In severe label noise benchmarks, our results are substantially better than other methods. }},

Several handcrafted architectures have been proposed in the literature, with increasing depth and millions of parameters. However, the optimal architecture size and parameters setup are dataset-dependent and challenging to find. For addressing this problem, this work proposes a Multi-Objective Grammatical Evolution framework to automatically generate suitable CNN architectures (layers and parameters) for a given classification problem. For this, a Context-free Grammar is developed, representing the search space of possible CNN architectures. The proposed method seeks to find suitable network architectures considering two objectives: accuracy and F1-score.

  abstract = {{The training of deep learning models generally requires a large amount of annotated data for effective convergence and generalisation. However, obtaining high-quality annotations is a laboursome and expensive process due to the need of expert radiologists for the labelling task. The study of semi-supervised learning in medical image analysis is then of crucial importance given that it is much less expensive to obtain unlabelled images than to acquire images labelled by expert radiologists. Essentially, semi-supervised methods leverage large sets of unlabelled data to enable better training convergence and generalisation than using only the small set of labelled images. In this paper, we propose Self-supervised Mean Teacher for Semi-supervised (S2MTS2) learning that combines self-supervised mean-teacher pre-training with semi-supervised fine-tuning. The main innovation of S2MTS2 is the self-supervised mean-teacher pre-training based on the joint contrastive learning, which uses an infinite number of pairs of positive query and key features to improve the mean-teacher representation. The model is then fine-tuned using the exponential moving average teacher framework trained with semi-supervised learning. We validate S2MTS2 on the multi-label classification problems from Chest X-ray14 and CheXpert, and the multi-class classification from ISIC2018, where we show that it outperforms the previous SOTA semi-supervised learning methods by a large margin.

  abstract = {{The efficacy of deep learning depends on large-scale data sets that have been carefully curated with reliable data acquisition and annotation processes. However, acquiring such large-scale data sets with precise annotations is very expensive and time-consuming, and the cheap alternatives often yield data sets that have noisy labels. The field has addressed this problem by focusing on training models under two types of label noise: 1) closed-set noise, where some training samples are incorrectly annotated to a training label other than their known true class; and 2) open-set noise, where the training set includes samples that possess a true class that is (strictly) not contained in the set of known training labels. In this work, we study a new variant of the noisy label problem that combines the open-set and closed-set noisy labels, and introduce a benchmark evaluation to assess the performance of training algorithms under this setup. We argue that such problem is more general and better reflects the noisy label scenarios in practice. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm, called EvidentialMix, that addresses this problem and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art methods for both closed-set and open-set noise on the proposed benchmark. Our results show that our method produces superior classification results and better feature representations than previous state-of-the-art methods.}},
